Compass Extension Example
==========================

There are a lot of cool things that Sass and Compass can do. This is a little compass extension that shows examples on how to fully utilize Compass and Sass to create your own extensions to use.

## How can I use this?

Look at it, install it, and see how it is used and how to utilize it yourself. Then make your own. I recomend starting with [Team Sass' extension template](https://github.com/Team-Sass/Compass-Extension-Template).

## What is inside?

There is example code on the following areas:

### Creating Compass extensions

### Using Compass extensions to make templates

### How to write Sass Code
* Variables
* Functions
* Mixins
* Logical Expressions
* Debugging

### TODO: How to publish your extension


## What other resources are there?

The internet. Google is your friend. Below are some helpful links of places that have excellent help.

* [Sass homepage](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Sass Documentation](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/_index.html)
* [Compass homepage](http://compass-style.org/)
* The Github repositories of [Team Sass](https://github.com/Team-Sass) contain excellent examples of top-notch extensions.
